  - heading: "Introduction"
    body: >
      This introduction establishes the purpose of the demo manuscript, explaining
      that Greyline OS validates structure, checks word counts, and proves
      reproducibility. Each sentence is intentionally simple so the validator
      can demonstrate pass conditions without ambiguity or hidden complexity.
  - heading: "Method and Workflow"
    body: >
      The workflow begins with validation, then compilation into deterministic
      markdown, followed by rendering and provenance hashing. By keeping inputs
      stable, the resulting outputs remain identical, which allows the CI
      pipeline to confirm integrity through repeatable checksum comparisons today.
  - heading: "Conclusion and Next Steps"
    body: >
      The conclusion summarizes the deterministic approach and invites reviewers
      to run the demo locally or in CI. Future steps include Typst and Pandoc
      integrations, mobile companion synchronization, and expanded schema support
      while preserving strict fail-closed behavior for professional publishing.
