        Today I appreciate having a clear checklist that keeps my effort aligned,
        because small consistent steps beat frantic leaps. The structure turns chaos
        into momentum, and that quiet relief helps me notice simple wins already.
      - >
        My focus is to finish one deliberate block without multitasking or chatter,
        then commit results publicly. This builds trust with myself and proves
        that steady progress can be measured, repeated, and improved tomorrow.

        Yesterday I rushed the ending of a task to log a quick win, which made
        today harder than necessary. Next time I will close the loop completely,
        documenting context so reentry is smooth and my energy stays available.
      - >
        I will reduce context switching by batching messages, scheduling short
        reviews, and protecting deep work time. Protecting attention increases
        quality, which compounds into calmer days and more reliable outcomes overall.
  - day: 3
    prompts: ["Momentum", "One Thing"]
    responses:

        Momentum grows when friction shrinks, so I prepared files, commands,
        and notes before starting. Beginning felt lighter, my pace steadier, and
        the work produced clearer artifacts that will help tomorrow move faster again.
      - >
        The one thing that matters is completing a deterministic render plus
        provenance update. If I deliver those artifacts cleanly, everything else
        can follow without pressure because the system proves progress objectively.
