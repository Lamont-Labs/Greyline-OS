# Greyline OS â€” Investor One-Pager

**Problem**  
Long-form writing breaks under drift and inconsistency; outputs are not verifiable.

**Solution**  
Greyline OS enforces structure and provenance. Re-renders are hash-identical.

**Why Now**  
AI tooling is prolific; deterministic, auditable publishing is the missing layer.

**Differentiators**  
- Fail-closed validator  
- Hash-stable outputs  
- Local, transparent pipeline

**Buyer**  
Publishing platforms, compliance-focused content firms.

**Proof Plan**  
`verify.sh` demonstrates identical hashes under repeat builds.
