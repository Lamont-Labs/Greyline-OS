# Security â€” Greyline OS v3.3.4

**Data Handling**  
No external data or secrets. All content synthetic or local demo text.

**Supply Chain**  
Dependencies pinned in `requirements.txt`. Lockfiles will be added for CI builds.

**SBOM Plan**  
CycloneDX JSON auto-generated by CLI (`greyline_cli sbom`).

**Signing**  
Planned PGP release signing for official bundles.

**Threat Model (Seed Stage)**  
- Scope limited to local text processing.  
- No network attack surface.  
- Provenance hashes prevent tampering.  
- Integrity verified through checksum validation.

**Known Gaps**  
- No secret management service.  
- No sandbox runtime isolation (not required at demo level).
